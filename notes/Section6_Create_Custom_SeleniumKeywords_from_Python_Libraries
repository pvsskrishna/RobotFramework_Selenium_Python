Q. What are custom User defined Keywords? and why should we need them?

Ans:
NOTE: Here "Custom user defined keywords" and Keywords what we created under *** Keywords *** is different.

Here user defined custom keywords means, Just like how we are using some keywords from Robot framework like
    Switch Window, Click Element etc...
    these all are selenium library keywords from robot framework.

   Similarly, now we are creating our own library which is having Our own custom user defined keywords.

But Why?
--------
    if we remember this below code.

        *** Keywords ***
        Select the card
            [Arguments]    ${cardname}
            @{elements}=    Get Webelements    ${Card_Titles}
            ${index}    Set Variable    1
            FOR    ${element}    IN    @{elements}
                Exit For Loop If    '${element.text}' == '${cardname}'    #quotes are from syntax
                ${index} =    Evaluate    ${index} + 1    #We need to add Evaluate Keyword, For every steps or line there should be one Keyword in Robot Framework
            END
            Click Button    xpath:(//button[@class='btn btn-info'])[${index}]
            Log     ${element.text}

    The above scenario is clicking a single element from a e-commerce site to add that to a cart.

    what if we want to click two items, or n items. Then this code will become much more complex where we loose flavour of robot framework.
    So, to avoid that we are using these "Custom User Defined Keywords"

Q. How to Achieve:

    Step 1:
        Create a new directory or folder in hierarchy.
            Ex: customLibraries

    Step 2:
        Create a python file.
            Ex: Shop.py

    Step 3:
        Inside that file create a class with the file name.
        RULE: Name of the file and Class name should be exactly same.

        Ex:
            if class name is -----> class Shop:
            then, file name should be -----> Shop.py

    Step 4:
        Here in this class what ever method we write will be considered as Keyword.
        But to use it we need to import the file name just like "Library    SeleniumLibrary" in *** Settings ***

        Library     ../customLibraries/Shop.py

        Ex:
            class Shop:
                def __init__(self):
                    #method name will be converted to keyword name --> Hello World

                def hellow_world(self):
                    print("hello")

    Step 5:
        But we need to provide some tweaks to this python file, Like
        @library -----> add this on top class, so that RF will think that it is not a normal class it is a Library.
        @keyword -----> add this on top of method, so RF will think it is a keyword.

        Ex:
            from robot.api.deco import library, keyword

            @library
            class Shop:
                #def __init__(self):
                    #method name will be converted to keyword name --> Hello World

                @keyword
                def hellow_world(self):
                    print("hello")

        If @library and @keyword are displaying error red line, that means you need to import below line.
        from robot.api.deco import library, keyword
        (No need to remember this automatically on mouse hovering it will display to import)

That's it we can make use of the keywords present in that developed in customLibraries
    Ex: In this case we can use Hello World keyword
