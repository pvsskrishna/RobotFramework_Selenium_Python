Q. How to execute all the test files present in a specific folder.
ans:
    1. Just change the path to the desired folder
    2. use this command "robot ."

    Ex: PS C:\Users\varun\PycharmProjects\RobotFramework\tests> robot .

    here using this command in terminal will execute all the test files present in that path.

    Note: This test execution will happen in a sequence one by one.
    This is really required to run the tests in a bulk

Q. How to run the tests parallel?
Ans:
    There is one plugin PABOT

    Pabot:
    ------
    Source: https://github.com/mkorpela/pabot/

    It is a Parallel executor for Robot Framework test. with Pabot we can split one execution into multiple and save test execution time.
    - we can trigger all test files at a time in a test folder or
    - we can tigger all test cases present inside a single test file.(one single file)

    Basic use:
    ----------
    Split execution to suite files.
        Syntax:    pabot [path to tests]
        Ex: pabot C:\Users\varun\PycharmProjects\RobotFramework\tests

    Split execution on test level.
        Syntax:    pabot --testlevelsplit [path to tests]
        Ex: pabot --testlevelsplit testDemo7.robot

    Run same tests with two different configurations.
        Syntax:    pabot --argumentfile1 first.args --argumentfile2 second.args [path to tests]

    By using the below command we can execute the test files parallely
        pabot .
