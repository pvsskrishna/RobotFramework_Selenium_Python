Tricks:
-------
  1. Execute test cases by test name   --->  robot -t "<testname>" .

    In this command line . (dot) referred to search the <testname> in all test files
    if you want to execute that <testname> in any specific test file we can give that test file name

    Ex: robot -t "Valid Login Test" testDemo2.robot

  2. Execute test cases by test name   --->  robot -t "<testname>" .

    In this command line - we can make use regular expression for the <testname>
    instead of giving full name we can give partial name by keeping *
    It will execute all the tests which are starting with testname starting with "Valid" from all test files.

    Ex: robot -t "Valid*" testDemo2.robot .

  3. Execute test cases by tag    ---> robot --include <tagname> .

    we can attach tags to the test cases just like how we are configuring the arguments.
    Ex:
        Validate UnSuccessful Login
            [Tags]      SMOKE                                                   ---> Just like this
            Fill the login form    ${valid_user_name}    ${invalid_password}
            wait until element is loaded    ${Error_Message_Login}
            verify the error message is correct

        So next time we can run the tests based on the tags
            robot --include SMOKE .

  NOTE: Both OR and AND should be capital in commands.

  4. We can add multiple tags for the test cases by just give tab space and add one more tag
    ex: End to End Ecommerce Product Validation
            [Tags]    Regression    SMOKE

            ✅ Tags are case-insensitive: regression, Regression, and REGRESSION are all the same.
            ❌ --include RegressionORSMOKE won't match Regression or SMOKE unless a tag is literally RegressionORSMOKE.
            ✅ Use --include "Regression OR SMOKE" to run tests with either tag.

  5. robot --rerunfailed output.xml .
        Basically this command is used to re-run all the failed testcases.

        🔁 Robot Framework: Rerun Failed Tests

        Command:
        robot --rerunfailed output.xml .

        📌 Description:
        This command reruns only the failed test cases from a previous Robot Framework test execution.

        🧩 Breakdown:
         robot: Runs Robot Framework.
         --rerunfailed output.xml: Tells Robot to rerun only the tests that failed in the given output.xml file.
         . : Refers to the current directory (where your test cases are located).

        ✅ Use Case:
        Useful when you want to save time by rerunning only the failed test cases instead of the full suite.

        🔄 Optional (Merging Results):
        After rerun, merge the original and rerun results into a final report using:
        rebot --merge output.xml rerun.xml

        ⚠️ Note:
        Make sure output.xml exists and is generated from a previous Robot run.

Q. How to set variable values from runtime command-line arguments in Robot Framework❓
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ✅ Use Case:
        You may want to dynamically decide which browser the test should use at runtime, instead of hardcoding the browser name in your scripts.

    🔸 Scenario:
        Currently, the browser is hardcoded in the script. Instead, let’s define it as a global variable,
        so all test cases refer to this single variable (${browser_name}).
        This way, we can override its value from the command line when needed.

    🔹 Step-by-Step:

        Step 1: Set a default browser in your generic/shared variable file
            - For example, set:
                *** Variables ***
                ${browser_name}    Chrome
            - Don’t pass browser_name from the command line unless you want to override it.
            - Update your test cases to use ${browser_name} wherever browser initialization is done.

        Step 2: Override the browser from the command line at runtime
            If you want to run the tests on a different browser (say Firefox), use:
                robot --variable browser_name:Firefox testDemo7.robot
            This will override the default Chrome value and use Firefox instead.

    ℹ️ Notes:
        - The --variable syntax is:
            --variable variable_name:value
        - The variable_name part should match the variable name without the ${}.
          For example, if your script uses ${browser_name}, then you must pass:
            --variable browser_name:SomeValue
        - The variable should be Global variable i.e it can be in any file but it must be under ***variables***


    6. We can pass multiple flags,variables in command line
        ex:
            robot --variable browser_name:Firefox --include SMOKE testDemo7.robot
            robot --variable browser_name:Firefox --include SMOKE -t "Valid Login Test" testDemo7.robot

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
--------------------

    1. How do you set the command line arguments?
    2. How to return the value from keyword?
        Ans: ${result} =     Get Text    ${Error_Message_Login}
    3. How do you share the variables from one keyword to another keyword?
        Ans:
        *** Keywords ***
        Grab the Email id present in the child window                       ---> Keyword 1
            ${mail_id}=    Get From List    ${2nd_split_list}    0          ---> Variable
            Log    ${mail_id}
            Set Global Variable        ${mail_id}                           ---> Making variable global

        Switch back to the Parent window and enter the Email Id             ---> Keyword 2
            Switch Window    MAIN
            Title Should Be    LoginPage Practise | Rahul Shetty Academy
            Input Text        id:username    ${mail_id}    Clear Element Text
            log     ${mail_id}

        Here ${mail_id} is a variable from 1st keyword but i want to use it in another keyword.
        for that, we have to made that variable as global variable by using "Global Variable"
        That make the variable to go into global scope and we access in another keyword

    4. How do yu get your robot framework selenium instance to your custom library python file?
        Ans: ---> BuiltIn().get_library_instance("Seleniumlibrary")
            Ex:
            from robot.libraries.BuiltIn import BuiltIn

Jenkins:
--------
    Installation:
    --------------
        1. Go to jenkins Official site - download "Generic Java Package (war)" LTS version.
            It will be around 89MB
        2. It will download as jenkins.war file
        3. Open command prompt - Change the path to where exactly this jenkins.war file is located/downloaded.
            Basically jenkins is not a tool - its run in our own server(local machine is acts as server).
        4. in command pmpt start opening this jar or war file with the below command.

            java -jar jenkins.war -httpPort=9090

            basically we are asking java to open the jar/war file if we give like this in the given port 9090.
        5. If there is an error like this:

            C:\Users\varun\Downloads>java -jar jenkins.war -httpPort=9090
            'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
             operable program or batch file.

             Then we need to install the java

                1. Go to: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html
                2. Download and install the Java SE Development Kit (JDK) – version 11 or higher is fine for Jenkins.
                3. During installation, note the install location, typically:
                    C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-XX
                4. Add Java to PATH
                    Press Win + S, search for "Environment Variables" and open it.
                    In System Properties → Advanced → Click Environment Variables.
                    Under System variables, find and select Path, then click Edit.
                    Click New, and add this path (adjust based on your JDK version):
                        C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-XX\bin
                5. Verify Setup
                    java -version

                6. Best practice: create jenkins name folder in c drive and move that jenkins.war file into it.
                7. now use this command from that .war file path in cmd pmpt --->java -jar jenkins.war -httpPort=9090
                    it will run some logs and generate
                     An admin user has been created and a password generated.
                     Please use the following password to proceed to installation:

                     336ebecc7da6459ab6c3b1cda0071eee

                     now Jenkins is fully up and running

        6. Now use this following command in browser
            http://localhost:8080   (if it is using another port replace with it)
            we can find in which port jenkins is running in logs generated in cmd pmt during jenkins activation.
            Ex:
            2025-07-23 12:11:40.922+0000 [id=1]     INFO    o.e.j.server.AbstractConnector#doStart: Started ServerConnector@5f577419{HTTP/1.1, (http/1.1)}{0.0.0.0:8080}

        7. Once after opening http://localhost:8080
            it will ask for administrator password
            (we can find that in logs produced during jenkins activation in cmd pmt or
             This may also be found at: C:\Users\varun\.jenkins\secrets\initialAdminPassword )

    Configuration:
    --------------
    1. Once installation is done yo will be landed into dashboard where you can see the "New Item" in left menu.
    2. Give your project name and select Free style and click ok. - The job will be created
    3. Firstly we have to provide path of our project
        if our project is in git repo - then we can pass the git repository url. in source code management.
        or if it is in local - go to General > Advanced
            check the box for "Use custom workspace" and copy the absolute path of the project folder and past it in directory.
        Now this jenkin job knows where exactly our project is located.
    4. Go to Build steps > Add build steps dropdown.
        select "Execute Windows batch command" ---> for windows user if apple use "Execute Shell"
        provide the commands that should execute while running the build
        Ex:
            cd tests
            robot --variable browser_name:Firefox --include REGRESSION .

        cd tests ---> will take the jenkins to test folder where our tests were exist and execute the command provided below it.
    5. Click save, that's it our project is ready in jenkins, we can see our project name in dashboard.
