Q. How to load the data from csv to robot tests - external plugins? ---->testDemo5.robot

Situation:
    1. If we don't want data displayed in tests
    2. Don't want test data should be existed in test files
    3. To make the data available from external files like CSV.

Steps to Achieve:
    To achieve this directly we cant do this because Robot framework is not providing any inbuilt features.
    we can install another plugin - just like another library is "datadriver".
    But by default Data driver library will not come with robot framework installation.
    So, how "robotframework-seleniumlibrary" installed separately we have to install "robotframwework-datadriver" library as well.

Steps:
1. add Library  DataDriver in *** Settings ***

    Library  DataDriver     file=resources/data.csv     encoding=utf_8      dialect=unix

2. Change the *** Test Cases *** as below.

    *** Test Cases ***
    Login with username ${username} and password ${password}

    # we can also add some default data incase file got corrupted like below.
    Login with username ${username} and password ${password}    abc     1234

3.  In CSV file add the data from *** Test Cases *** as follows:
    (Just like the *** Test Cases *** section used to have the data- but with coma separated)

    *** Test Cases ***,username,password
    Valid UN and Invalid PWD,rahulshettyacademy,learn
    Invalid UN and Valid PWD,rahul,learning
    Invalid UN and Invalid PWD,rahul,learn
    Special characters,!%&,!@}})
    Numbers,12345,6543

    NOTE: username and password in first line should be exact match with the [Arguments] present in *** Keywords ***
    i.e ${username},${password}
    Because, The *** Keywords *** is having arguments ${username}and ${password}.
            *** Keywords ***
            Validate UnSuccessful Login
                [Arguments]        ${username}        ${password}
                Fill the login form    ${username}        ${password}
                wait until it checks and displays error message
                verify the error message is correct
                These names have to be column headers in CSV file as column header.

    *** Test Cases ***,${username},${password}
    Valid UN and Invalid PWD,rahulshettyacademy,learn
    Invalid UN and Valid PWD,rahul,learning
    Invalid UN and Invalid PWD,rahul,learn
    Special characters,!%&,!@}})
    Numbers,12345,6543

=========================== That's it - we are ready to do data driven testing using csv file ==================================

what is this sentence ?
    *** Test Cases ***
    Login with username ${username} and password ${password} ----> this sentence?

Explanation:
    Point 1:
        In csv file writing *** Test Cases *** name is not mandatory.
            ex: Valid UN and Invalid PWD

        we can also provide data without giving the test case name in csv file.
            ex: *** Test Cases ***,${username},${password}
                Valid UN and Invalid PWD,rahulshettyacademy,learn
                ,rahul,learning

        Just leave the Test case name empty by giving the coma ","

    Point 2:
        If we don't provide Test case name in CSV, Then that empty place will be taken care by this line.
        Login with username ${username} and password ${password}

        So, directly username and password will be fetched to that line.

        Similarly, when system unable to connect with csv file it will use default data that we provide.
        Login with username ${username} and password ${password}    varun       12345
